Other Implementations

<dl>

<dt>In Perl <a href="http://charles.karney.info/misc/secret.html">Implementation of Shamir's method for sharing a secret</a>::</dt>

<dd>Small, easy to use. "Algorithm is applied to the key one byte at a time", which means as far as cryptography is concerned, it should not be trusted. It also means it is not compatible with my version.</dd>


<dt>In Adobe Flex/Flash <a href="http://www.christophedavid.org/w/c/w.php/Calculators/ShamirSecretSharing">Shamir's "How to share a Secret"</a>::</dt>


<dd>No source available [which means it should not be trusted]. Simple "share format" of NNkkFFhhhhhhhhhhh (example: 01033ED38FFE2E2F57CDE8BB) where NN is the "x"/01, kk is the "k"/03, ff are useless flags/3E, and the rest is hex encoding of the characters in this secret share.</dd>

<dt>In c <a href="http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/">Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme</a>::</dt>


<dd>Too simple "share format" of NN-hhhhhhhhhh where NN/x is provided, but not "k"</dd>

<dt>In Clojure <a href="https://github.com/pelle/secretshare">Shamir Secret Sharing for Clojure based on secretsharejava</a></dt>

<dd>Wonderful application in Clojure.  Based on this library as hosted at SourceForge</dd>

<dt>In Java <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/secretsharejava/">Shamir Secret Sharing in Java</a></dt>

<dd>The original location for this project.  Out of date.  Uses ant instead of gradle.</dd>
